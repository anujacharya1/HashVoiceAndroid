HashVoice
=========

Yahoo! Hackathon

Android application tthat allows the user to tag a picture through simple voice commands or text .
Users could tag (hash) their pictures (from Gallery, SD card etc..) on a mobile phone and upload it to a cloud.
(Here the backend server we have used was that of Yahoo Flickr. Backend code is not part of this workspace).

Users can later retreive it using the same 'hash' / tag from the server on to their Android devices.
